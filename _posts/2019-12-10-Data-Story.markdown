## Make Amazon Healthy Again!

# Teaser

People buy anything on Amazon nowadays, because it's so unbelievably simple. You just order it and when you don't like it, you send it back. This concept might work well for electronic devices or clothing, but gets difficult when it comes to food and groceries. Once you have your food intoxication, you can maybe try to sue Amazon for that, but before you're successfull you might already have passed away. Of course this can also happen in your local store, the advantage of Amazon is the BIG DATA that comes along with it. Usually, people don't die directly from contaminated food, so they have time to complain about their purchases - and they do! When being displeased with products, they write angry reviews about them. The question for a data scientist now is: **by analyzing Amazon reviews of food products and groceries, can we detect dangerous, possibly contaminated or intoxicated products?** That question was part of our project and will be adressed in the following data story!

## Introduction and Results

Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon is constantly growing.
