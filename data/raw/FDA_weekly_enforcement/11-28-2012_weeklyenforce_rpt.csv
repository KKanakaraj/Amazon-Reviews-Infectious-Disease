The monitor is 26.2 cm x 31.5 cm x 13.2 cm and weighs 4.1 kg (10.3 inches x 12.4 inches x 5.2 inches - 9 lbs).  It has a 26.2 cm (12.1 inches) LCD display with 1024 x 768 resolution.      The Spacelabs Healthcare Qube Compact Monitor (91390), functioning as either bedside or central monitors; passively displays data generated by 2 Spacelabs Healthcare parameter modules, Flexports interfaces, and other SDLC based products in the form of waveform and numeric displays, trends and alarms. Key monitored parameters available on the Model 91390 when employing the Spacelabs Command Module, consist of ECU, respiration, invasive and noninvasive blood pressure, Sp02, temperature and cardiac output. Additional parameters and interfaces to other systems are also available depending on the parameter modules employed. The Qube is intended to alert the user to alarm conditions that are reported by Spacelabs Healthcare parameter modules and/or other physiologic monitors via Flexport interfaces. These devices determine a) when an alarm condition is violated; b) the alarm priority (i.e. high, medium or low); c) alarm limits; and d) when to initiate and terminate alarm notifications. The patient monitors are also capable of displaying alarm conditions on other monitors that are on the network through the Alarm Watch feature. The Qube may also function as a generic display or computer terminal. As a generic display or terminal, the patient monitors allow network-based applications to open windows and display information on other networked monitors. The Qube is also designed to communicate with a variety of external devices such as displays, network devices, serial devices, user input devices, audio systems, and local/remote recorders.
