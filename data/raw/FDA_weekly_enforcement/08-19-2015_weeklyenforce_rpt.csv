The Oasis system produces transverse, coronal, sagittal, oblique, and curved cross-sectional images that display the internal structure of the head, body, or extremities. The images produced by the MR systems reflect the spatial distribution of protons (hydrogen nuclei) exhibiting magnetic resonance. The NMR properties that determine the image appearance are proton density, spin-lattice relaxation time (T1), spin-spin relaxation time (T2), and flow. When interpreted by a trained physician, these images provide information that can be useful in diagnosis determination. The Coil Extension Cable that is the subject of the removal action is an accessory that is used in conjunction with certain anatomy coils to aid in patient positioning.
