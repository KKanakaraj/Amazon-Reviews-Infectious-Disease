Gases available for medical use do not contain sufficient moisture and may damage or irritate the respiratory tract, or desiccate secretions of patients whose supraglottic airways have been bypassed. Thus humidified gases via heated breathing circuit may be indicated for patients requiring mechanical ventilation, positive pressure breathing assistance, or general medical gases. These gases may be delivered by nasal prongs using the CareFusion Infant Flow system and the single limb circuit, or through bypassing upper airways, for example through the use of an endotracheal tube with the dual limb configuration.
