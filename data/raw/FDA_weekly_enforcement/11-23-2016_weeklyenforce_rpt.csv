(30/Box), Sterile    Product Usage:  The catheter is an all silicone, single lumen, drainage tube with drainage eyes at the proximal end and a tapered funnel at the distal end. The outer surface of the catheter has an antibacterial and hydrophilic coating which binds water molecules to the surface creating a smooth lubricating film. It is packaged with a water sachet that is manually burst to hydrate the catheter coating at time of use. The catheters are packaged in a film-to-film pouch and are sterilized by electron beam irradiation and are distributed as a single use device. The catheter is intended for urinary bladder drainage in adult males and females requiring catheterization for management of incontinence, voiding dysfunction and surgical procedures. Efficacy of the catheter in preventing urinary tract infection during intermittent use has not been established. The device is not intended to be used as a treatment for active urinary tract infection. For urological use only; urinary catheters are intended for use for bladder management including urine drainage, collection and measurement. The devices are passed to the urinary bladder via the urethra.
