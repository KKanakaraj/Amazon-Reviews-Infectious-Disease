It consists of internal and external components. The internal components include a stimulator (HiRes90K ICS) and electrode array (HiFocus 1j or Helix). The HiRes90K ICS is implanted surgically under the skin behind the ear. The electrode array is inserted into the cochlea. The external components include a sound processor (body-worn or ear-level), a headpiece, and a cable. The system converts sound into electrical energy that activates the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve then sends information to the brain, where it is interpreted as sound. The Helix consists of a fantail, electrode lead, and Helix electrode array. The electrode, comprised of platinum-iridium wires, is housed in a silicone carrier and extends from the titanium case. The Helix electrode array is 24.5 mm in length and is designed to be inserted approximately 18-21 mm into a normal patent cochlea. It consists of 16 planar contacts arranged along the medial surface of the electrode array for stimulation of discrete segments of the cochlea. The Helix electrode insertion tool is designed to assist the surgeon with the insertion of the Helix electrode. Only the Helix insertion should be used for insertion of the Helix electrode; the use of other instruments may result in damage to the electrode. The insertion tool is a single-use instrument.","17 units","Advanced Bionics is recalling the the HiRes 90K cochlear implant with HiFocus Helix Electrode because of loose-fitting insertion tool assemblies.","09/14/2007","10/22/2012","10/22/2012","10/31/2012","Serial Numbers:    351323, 251153, 350989, 351226, 350196, 351136, 350140, 350201, 351261, 351264, 351266, 351269, 351412, 351415, 351429, 350157, 351303."
