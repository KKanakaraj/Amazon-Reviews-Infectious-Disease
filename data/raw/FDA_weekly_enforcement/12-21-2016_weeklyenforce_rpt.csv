The failure mode is directly related to contaminated material in the plastic housing used to produce the DUOMAT 3 motor.

Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. 263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories. Results are for the identification of Zika virus RNA. Zika virus RNA is generally detectable in serum during the acute phase of infection (approximately 7 days following onset of symptoms, if present). Positive results are indicative of current infection. Laboratories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities. Within the United States and its territories positive results must be reported to appropriate state/local public health authorities. Negative results do not preclude Zika virus infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. The LightMix Zika rRT-PCR Test is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of realtime PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures. The Test is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration s Emergency Use Authorization.","24 pieces","The LightCycler 480 algorithm used for the LightMix Zika rRT-PCR Test, EUA (catalog number  07987897001) occasionally (~1% of the time) calls a positive result for a negative sample if there is  an inflection point in the fluorescence signal.","11/16/2016","12/13/2016","12/12/2017","12/21/2016","38161611"
