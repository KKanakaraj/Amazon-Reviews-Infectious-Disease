These fluids may include pharmaceutical drugs, blood, blood products and mixture of required patient therapy. The intended routes of administration consist of the following clinically accepted routes: intravenous, arterial, subcutaneous, intrathecal, epidural or irrigation of fluid space. Spectrum Infusion Pump is intended to be used in conjunction with legally marketed intravenous administration sets and medications provided by the user. The Spectrum and Spectrum with Master Drug Library is suitable for many user facility applications such as but not limited to hospitals, outpatient care areas, homecare and ambulatory care services. Spectrum and Spectrum with Master Drug Library is intended to reduce operator interaction through automated programming thereby helping to reduce errors associated with complex device programming. Parameter programming requires trained healthcare professional confirmation of limits and drug therapy to the physician s directive.","158","The flow rate test verification was not properly executed for certain Sigma Spectrum infusion pumps prior to release. The testing was performed for less than the required minimum run time. Improperly performed flow rate testing may not identify issues with pumps that could cause inaccuracies in flow rates which, in turn, could lead to over- or under- infusion. Potential risk to the patient depends on a number of factors including treatment and patient comorbidities. Depending on these factors, the patient could experience serious adverse health consequences.","06/21/2018","05/02/2019","05/23/2019","05/08/2019","414100  414670  433162  710740  717215  719988  720854  721951  722543  722933  725642  732556  734067  749265  749642  749657  751266  754953  755565  756625  756644  758179  759427  760110  760525  761003  762192  763831  764008  772521  772551  772633  776752  777472  777487  777680  777749  778181  778251  778579  779966  780547  780718  780817  782396  782707  782811  783349  783493  786411  788383  788710  789338  789840  790679  792271  792369  794031  794748  799042  800030  801760  801943  803923  804476  804682  806531  813188  814142  816514  820804  821669  823024  823027  824627  824732  825824  826787  829610  831764  832868  834783  835743  836236  837842  839622  840360  840428  841012  841184  841214  841342  842898  843667  843683  847890  848208  848231  848488  848787  849440  849507  849907  850267  850852  851179  851268  852222  853708  854814  855334  855504  855857  856876  856969  858560  860351  861014  861464  861482  863379  868085  870747  871288  874631  875102  875155  878163  878164  881784  884140  892778  894505  899196  909742  910678  918775  921328  923433  937769  942978  944660  945944  949235  953654  954700  954902  963058  970869  974360  976700  977543  981313  983629  984364  988111  988760  995070"
