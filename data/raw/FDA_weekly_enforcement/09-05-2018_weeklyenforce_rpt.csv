CDT results in absolute concentrations may be influenced by patients transferrin levels and, therefore, results are reported as ratio of CDT to total transferrin, called %CDT.      As the transferrin determination with N Antiserum to Human Transferrin is not affected, the observed effect leads to calculated %CDT values that show a negative bias of approximately 15% compared to the HPLC method. This could result in a shift of weak positive patient samples into the reference range of 1.19  2.47 %CDT which was derived from a study population of healthy adults.
