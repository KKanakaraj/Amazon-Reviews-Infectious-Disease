It is designed to store and manage the received data and make reports as necessary. The application is installed on Dell All- in-One computers that do not have serial (RS232) ports only USB ports. The G8 analyzer does not have USB ports. The Key Span Adaptor connects the serial port on the G8 to the USB port on the Dell computer. Once installed the Keyspan adapter is assigned a COM port. The default for the firmware is dynamic which randomly assigns a port for the transmission of data. The port assignment can change when the power for the analyzer or computer is shut down or the cable is physically disconnected and then reconnected. The default can be changed to geographic which allows the port assignment to be static regardless of a power outage.
