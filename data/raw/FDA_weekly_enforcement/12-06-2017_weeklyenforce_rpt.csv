The iMLSb resistance D-test screen for Staphylococcus species is used to identify phenotypic drug resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin.  As the product should not be used when quality control (QC) fails, it is unlikely that there would be any impact on patient results, however, if a customer does not perform QC testing and uses the panel, there is a potential to incorrectly treat a Staphylococcus infection with clindamycin based on the iMLSb test result. This issue can be detected 100% of the time when used per package insert instructions with iMLSb positive strain S. aureus BAA-977.","05/11/2017","11/25/2017","02/06/2018","12/06/2017","Lot 7031818, Exp.

ExacTrac Vero uses the images received from the MHI-TM2000 linear accelerator for analyzing the current patient position and calculating - when applicable - a necessary correction shift. The correction shift is then exported to the MHI-TM2000 linear accelerator. The ExacTrac Vero system uses stereoscopic X-ray or Cone Beam CT registration and optical tracking of infrared reflective markers in order to localize and correct the patient position before and during treatment. Optionally ExacTrac Vero provides position data for the pan/tilt motion of the MHI-TM2000 gantry head to the MHITM2000 controller for continuous alignment of the beam orientation with a moving target. The position data is based on target detection via X-ray imaging and IR tracking of external surrogate markers.","28 units","Brainlab has internally detected that under specific conditions ExacTrac Vero may not correctly account for this ring angle correction during the calculation of the corresponding couch shift.  This may result in the treatment couch not moving to the exact planned position resulting in a deviation between the planned and the treatment target position. This deviation may not be clearly visible to the user if no verification image of the patient position is acquired after this couch shift has been performed.","11/03/2017","11/28/2017","","12/06/2017","Potentially affected are ExacTrac Vero versions 3.x. Currently only ExacTrac Vero SW versions 3.5(.x) are installed  for use on existing ExacTrac Vero Systems (only ExacTrac Vero v.3.5 exist in the field).  UDI:  04056481132446"
