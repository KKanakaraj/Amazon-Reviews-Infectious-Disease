Users can configure MOSAIQ for Medical Oncology use, Radiation Oncology use, or the two together. It lets users:  Assemble electronic patient charts and treatment plans, order diagnostic tests, and prescribe medications.  Generate and keep medication formulary lists and calculate applicable medication dosages for medical oncology.  Import, view, annotate, adjust, enhance, manage and archive images.  Compare radiation treatment plans and evaluate dose coverage.  Design leaf plans for operation with radiotherapy treatment machines that have multileaf collimators.  Make sure radiation treatment plans imported from treatment planning systems agree with treatment machine constraints. MOSAIQ reads actual settings from the treatment machine through the machine communication interface. It compares these settings with predefined values. If a mismatch occurs between the planned values and the actual machine settings, the system warns the user.  View reference images to setup treatment. MOSAIQ refers to predefined settings to help treatment machine setup, and communicates patient and machine setup instructions.  Record actual delivered radiation values in an electronic chart to track treatment.
