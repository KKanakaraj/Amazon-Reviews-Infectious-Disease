Indications for use: The Alere Triage¿ TOX Drug Screen is a fluorescence immunoassay to be used with the Alere Triage¿ Meters for the qualitative determination of the presence of drug and/or the major metabolites above the threshold concentrations of up to 10 distinct drug classes, including assays for acetaminophen/paracetamol, amphetamines, methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine, THC and tricyclic antidepressants in urine. The acetaminophen/paracetamol assay will yield positive results when acetaminophen/paracetamol is ingested at or above therapeutic doses. This test provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), Liquid Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry/ Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) are common confirmatory methods. A quantitative serum acetaminophen/paracetamol measurement is the common confirmatory method for preliminary positive acetaminophen/paracetamol results.","305 kits (239 kits of W56013B, 66 kits of W56035B)","Alere San Diego, Inc. is initiating a recall of the Alere Triage¿ TOX Drug Screen, Catalog Number 94400, Lots W56013B and W56035B because Alere's investigation has shown that these lots have a frequency of false negative results for PCP (Phencyclidine) that is higher than the frequency shown in the package insert.
