As a result, when the user performs High Resolution head scans, the reconstructed images may exhibit degraded image quality manifested as non-uniformity of the image, CT number shift greater than 5 Hounsfield units, and reduction in gray/white matter differentiation.  The issue is most sever in the High Resolution mode, and the factory reference pediatric scan protocols are set to High Resolution default.  Adults head scans have a factory reference protocol that defaults to standard resolution which doesn't experience the issue.","08/24/2016","10/03/2016","07/02/2018","10/12/2016","30016, 30023, 30024, 30151, 32000, 32001, 32008, 32010, 32012, 32013, 32015, 32016, 32018, 32021, 32022, 32024, 32026, 32028, 32032, 32033, 32034, 32036, 32037, 32041, 32042, 32043, 32044, 32046, 32047,  32048, 32049, 32050, 32051, 32052, 32053, 32054, 32055, 32056, 32057, 32058, 32059, 32060, 32061, 32062, 32063, 32064, 32065, 32066, 32067, 32068, 32069, 32070, 32071, 32072, 32073, 32074, 32075, 32076, 32077, 32078, 32079, 32080, 32081, 32082, 32084, 32085, 32086, 32087, 32088, 32089, 32090, 32091, 32092, 32093, 32094, 32095, 32096, 32097, 32098, 32099, 32100, 32101, 32102, 32103, 32104, 32105, 32106, 32108, 32109, 32110, 32111, 32112, 32113, 32114, 32115, 32116, 32117, 32118, 32119, 32120, 32121, 32122, 32123, 32124, 32125, 32126, 32127, 32128, 32129, 32130, 32131, 32133,                                                                                                                                                  32134, 32135, 32136, 32137, 32138, 32139, 32140, 32141, 32142, 32143, 32144, 32145, 32146, 32147, 32148, 32149, 32150, 32151, 32152, 32153, 32154, 32155, 32156, 32157, 32158, 32159, 32160, 32161, 32162, 32163, 32164, 32165, 32166, 32167, 32168, 32169, 32171, 32173, 52023, 52028, 52049, 52073,   320001, 320002, 320003, 320005, 320006, 320008, 320010, 320018, 320019, 320024, 320026, 320029, 320030, 320031, 320033, 320037, 320054, 320058, 320059, 320069, 320073, 320074, 320078, 320079, 320080, 320081, 320082, 320083, 320084, 320088, 320090, 320092, 320096, 320099, 320100, 320101, 320103, 320107, 320111, 320114, 320115, 320119, 320122, 320123, 320125, 320126, 320128, 320129, 320131, 320132, 320133, 320134, 320136, 320138, 320144, 320146, 320147, 320200, 320201, 320202, 320203, 320204, 320206, 320207, 320208, 320209, 320210, 320211, 320212, 320213, 320214, 320215, 320216, 320217, 320218, 320219, 320220, 320221, 320222, 320223, 320224, 320225, 320226, 320227, 320228, 320229, 320230, 320231, 320232, 320233, 320234, 320235, 320236, 320237, 320238, 320239, 320240, 320241, 320242, 320243, 320245, 320246, 320247, 320248, 320250, 320251, 320252, 320253, 320254, 320255, 320256, 320257, 320258, 320259, 320260, 320261, 320262, 320263, 320264, 320265, 320266, 320267, 320268, 320269, 320270, 320271, 320272, 320273, 320274, 320275, 320276, 320278, 320279, 320280, 320281, 320282, 320283, 320284, 320285, 320286, 320288, 320289, 320290, 320291, 320292, 320293, 320295, 320296, 320297, 320298, 320299, 320301, 320302, 320303, 320305, 320307, 320309, 320310, 320311, 320312, 320313, 336011, 336012, 336013, 336015, 336016, 336017, 336018, 336023, 336025, 336027, 336028, 336029, 336034, 336040, 336044, 336046, 336051, 336059, 336060, 336064, 336066, 336067, 336068, 336069, 336070, 336071, 336072, 336073, 336075, 336076, 336077, 336078, 336079, 336080, 336081, 336082, 336083, 336084, 336085, 336086, 336087, 336088, 336089, 336090, 336091, 336092, 336093, 336094, 336095, 336096, 336097, 336098, 336099, 336100, 336101, 336102, 336103, 336104, 336105, 336106, 336107, 336108, 336109, 336110, 336111, 336112, 336113, 336114, 336115, 336116, 336117, 336118, 336119, 336120, 336122, 336123, 336124, 336125, 336126, 336127, 336128, 336129, 336130, 336131, 336132, 336133, 336134, 336135, 336136, 336137, 336138, 336139, 336140, 336141, 336142, 336143, 336144, 336145, 336146, 336147, 336148, 336149, 336150, 336151, 336152, 336153, 336154, 336155, 336156, 336157, 336158, 336159, 336160, 336161, 336162, 336163, 336164, 336165, 336166, 336167, 336168, 336169, 336170, 336171, 336172, 336173, 336174, 336175, 336176, 336177, 336178, 336179, 336180, 336181, 336182, 336183, 336184, 336185, 336186, 336187, 336188, 336189, 336190, 336191, 336192, 336193, 336194, 336195, 336196, 336197, 336198, 336199, 336200, 336201, 336202, 336203, 336204, 336205, 336206, 336207, 336208, 336209, 336210, 336211, 336212, 336213, 336214, 336215, 336216, 336217, 336218, 336219, 336220, 336221, 336222, 336223, 336224, 336225, 336226, 336227, 336228, 336229, 336230, 336231, 336232, 336234 , 336235, 336236, 336241, 336243, 336245, 336246, 336247, 336248, 336249, 336252, 336256, 336781, 336782, 336783, 336784, 336785, 336786, 336787, 336788, 336789, 336790, 336791"

As a result, the hex geometry can still be visible, but there are radial cuts into the hex flat. Therefore, when the bolt is inserted into the augment, the screwdriver is unable to catch on the hex geometry, or the screwdriver strips the remaining hex geometry, and the bolt is unable to be fully tightened.    The bolt stripping or the bolt not being fully tightened will be noticed by the surgeon intraoperatively when he or she is unable to screw the augment bolts into the augment.
