The instrument places a circular, double-staggered row of titanium DST  staples and removes a circular tissue specimen. The instrument is offered in a 33mm diameter size with either 3.5mm or 4.8mm staples. The accompanying accessories comprised of an access port, anoscope, and dilator. The access port aids the insertion and removal of the anoscope and the stapler device by dilating the anal sphincter throughout the procedure. The anoscope is designed to facilitate pursestring suture application above the dentate line. It is designed with a guide and markings to assist in creating a circumferential pursestring suture at a consistent placement within the rectum. The dilator is designed to aid the initial insertion of the anoscope and port by retracting the rectal tissue. Both the anoscope and port are transparent to facilitate visualization of the anal canal.

The instrument places a circular, double-staggered row of titanium DST  staples and removes a circular tissue specimen. The instrument is offered in a 33mm diameter size with either 3.5mm or 4.8mm staples. The accompanying accessories comprised of an access port, anoscope, and dilator. The access port aids the insertion and removal of the anoscope and the stapler device by dilating the anal sphincter throughout the procedure. The anoscope is designed to facilitate pursestring suture application above the dentate line. It is designed with a guide and markings to assist in creating a circumferential pursestring suture at a consistent placement within the rectum. The dilator is designed to aid the initial insertion of the anoscope and port by retracting the rectal tissue. Both the anoscope and port are transparent to facilitate visualization of the anal canal.
