Customer notification letters recommended that users discontinue use of the Ktrans, Kep, and iAUGC colormaps when assessing studies from a remotely connected DynaCAD client computer. It is further advised that users refrain from using the colormaps and values derived from ADC maps calculated by DynaCAD. ADC maps originating natively from the MRI system should be used as an alternative as these values are unaffected.
