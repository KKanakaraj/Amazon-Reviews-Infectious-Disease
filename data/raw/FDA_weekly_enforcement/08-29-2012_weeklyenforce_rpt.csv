The device is a diagnostic imaging system for fixed or mobile installations that combines Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) systems. The CT subsystem produces cross-sectional images of the body by computer reconstruction of x-ray transmission data. The PET subsystem produces images of the distribution of PET radiopharmaceuticals in the patient body (specific radiopharmaceuticals are used for whole body, brain, heart and other organ imaging). Attenuation correction is accomplished by CTAC. The device also provides for list mode, dynamic, and gated acquisitions. Image processing and display workstations provide software applications to process, analyze, display, quantify and interpret medical images/data. The PET and CT images may be registered and displayed in a ""fused"" (overlaid in the same spatial orientation) format to provide combined metabolic and anatomical data at different angles. Trained professionals use the images in: "" The evaluation, detection and diagnosis of lesions, disease and organ function such as but not limited to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.
