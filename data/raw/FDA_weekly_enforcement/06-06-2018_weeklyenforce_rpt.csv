It generates various parametric images calculated from the image intensity variations and provides tools to extract and visualize such parametric properties within specified volumes of interest. Structural datasets providing anatomical information can be sued to evaluate the extent of a specified sub-volume, such as a tumor. Comparison of imaging studies performed at different study dates may also be performed to support the diagnostic process.","16 licenses","An error was discovered in the interpretation of certain DICOM header tags that may lead to incorrect orientation labeling, and thus and indirect left-right, up-down or anterior-posterior flipping of images.","12/15/2014","05/31/2018","","06/06/2018","Version 1.0.4"

","36 licenses","There is an error related to the relative geometry between fiber tracts in a fiber group and images.    The error occurs in the following situations: A group of fibers has been selected using the VOI functionality and put into a fiber group. This is done with images series A visualized in the 3D viewer. Then a new images series B is visualized in the 3D viewer. If image series A and B have the same geometrical resolution (pixel sizes and slice distances), the coregistration matrix taking A to B will not be applied to the fiber group, and therefore the fiber group will in general  not be positioned correctly on B in the 3D viewer. Furthermore, if the fiber group is exported as a new image series the fibers could be misplaced, and similarly if the fibers are visualized in the MPR on B, the positioning will not be correct. The misalignment will be equal to the rotations/translations necessary to align A with B.  ","12/21/2012","05/31/2018","","06/06/2018","version 1.1.2"
