BC-GN is performed directly on blood culture media using blood culture bottles identified as positive by a continuous monitoring blood culture system and which contain gram-negative bacteria as determined by gram stain. BC-GN is indicated for use in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory findings to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial bloodstream infections; however, is not used to monitor these infections. Sub-culturing of positive blood cultures is necessary to recover organisms for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), for identification of organisms not detected by BC-GN, to detect mixed infections that may not be detected by BC-GN, for association of antimicrobial resistance marker genes to a specific organisms, or for epidemiological typing. The BC-GN test is performed on the Verigene System platform, which is a fully automated, bench-top, molecular diagnostics workstation consisting of Verigene Reader and a bank of up to 32 Verigene Processor SP units.

The Verigene Clostridium difficile Nucleic Acid Test (CDF) is a qualitative multiplexed in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid detection of toxin A (tcdA), toxin B (tcdB), and tcdC gene sequences of toxigenic Clostridium difficile and for presumptive identification of PCR ribotype 027 strains from unformed (liquid or soft) stool specimens collected from patients suspected of having C. difficile infection (CDI). Presumptive identification of the PCR ribotype 027 strain of C. difficile is by detection of the binary toxin (cdt) gene sequence and the single base pair deletion at nucleotide 117 in the tcdC gene. The tcdC gene encodes for a negative regulator in C. difficile toxin production. The test is performed on the Verigene System and utilizes automated specimen preparation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, combined with a nanoparticle-based array hybridization assay to detect the toxin gene sequences associated with toxin-producing C. difficile. The CDF test is indicated for use as an aid in the diagnosis of CDI. Detection of PCR ribotype 027 strains of C. difficile by the CDF test is solely for epidemiological purposes and is not intended to guide or monitor treatment for C. difficile infections.
