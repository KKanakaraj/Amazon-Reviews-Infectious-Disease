Product  Usage:  The Alinity i (LN 03R65 01) processing module is a fully automated immunoassay analyzer allowing random and continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology. CMIA technology is used to determine the presence of antigens, antibodies, and analytes in samples. The Alinity c (LN 03R67 01) processing module is a fully automated chemistry analyzer allowing random and continuous access, as well as priority and automated retest processing using photometric and potentiometric detection technology. The Alinity c processing module uses photometric detection technology to measure sample absorbance for the quantification of analyte concentration and uses potentiometric detection technology to measure the electrical potential in a sample. In addition, the Alinity c processing module uses an integrated chip technology (ICT) module to measure potentiometric assays (electrolytes).
