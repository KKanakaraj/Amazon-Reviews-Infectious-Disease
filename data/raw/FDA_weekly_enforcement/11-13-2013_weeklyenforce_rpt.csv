As a component of the IS3000 da Vinci Si Surgical System, the 3DHD Vision System provides a high resolution image for the surgeon (at the 3D viewer) and the patient-side assistant (at the touchscreen). The 3DHD endoscope assembly (endoscope and camera head) can be used manually (that is, handheld, as with a traditional endoscopy cart) or can be mounted on the camera arm to assist with preoperative exploration. Also integrated in the Vision System Cart is the Illuminator. The illuminator has a single light source attached to the endoscopy assembly by the light guide cable.
