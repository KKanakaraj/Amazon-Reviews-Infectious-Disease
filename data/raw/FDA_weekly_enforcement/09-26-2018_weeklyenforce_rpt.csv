The URO-3 Triple Stain is an adjunct immunohistochemistry test to assist a qualified pathologist in differentiating urothelial reactive atypia from CIS (carcinoma in situ) in suspected bladder lesions. The URO-3 staining pattern will be used as supporting data along with morphological and patient history context for the qualified pathologist to render a diagnosis.
