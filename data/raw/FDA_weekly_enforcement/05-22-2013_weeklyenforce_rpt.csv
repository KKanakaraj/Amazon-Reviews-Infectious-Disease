It is designed to restore the natural process of urinary control. The device simulates normal sphincter function by opening and closing the urethra at the control of the patient. The AMS 800 system consists of three inter connected components: a cuff, a pump, and a pressure-regulating balloon. The three components are connected with kink-resistant tubing. The AMS 800 can be implanted at either the bulbous urethra or the bladder neck.
