Product Usage:  The Guardian hemostasis valves are designed to be used as conduits when interventional devices with diameters up to 8 F are inserted into the human vascular system.  The devices have two seals:  the low-pressure seal, and the high-pressure seal.  Closure of the high-pressure seal, which is achieved when the nut can no longer rotate, secures the diagnostic/interventional device in position within the vasculature and allows for pressure injections up to 600 psi.","5283","Vascular Solutions became aware of a potential problem with the click version of the Guardian II hemostasis valves.
