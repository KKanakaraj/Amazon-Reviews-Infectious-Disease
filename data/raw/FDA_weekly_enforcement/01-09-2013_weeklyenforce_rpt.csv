The microcuvette contains reagents deposited on its inner walls. The urine sample is drawn into the cavity by capillary action. The filled cuvette is inserted into the device where the contents of the cuvette are mixed through vibration. Within 90 seconds, the immunochemical reaction is completed and the turbidity is measured photometrically at 610 nm. The albumin concentration is proportional to the turbidity. When the end point is reached, the result is displayed in mg/L.    The system can be used for the quantitative determination of low levels of albumin in urine for the purpose of screening for, diagnosing, monitoring and to supplement the clinical evidence in the treatment of microalbuminuria.","48 affected analyzers","Incorrect version of Quick Reference Guide (QRG) was delivered with products in shipment made from April1 st 2011 and onwards.
