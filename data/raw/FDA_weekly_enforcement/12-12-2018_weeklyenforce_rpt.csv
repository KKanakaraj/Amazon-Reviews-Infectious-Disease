Loose hardware can cause wear to the hardware and housings. If left unresolved, the caster may separate from the base of the lift causing the Lift to tilt and a patient fall. Failure does not occur right away but happens over time if the lift is not properly maintained.  Patient falls are inherently dangerous and may result in a range of injuries that are dependent on physical condition of the patient and the nature of the fall. When injuries occur, they are typically non-serious injuries such as bruising, lacerations, or abrasions. In rare cases, more serious injuries such as bone fracture, head trauma, or death can occur.  For caregivers using the lift, attempts to manually stabilize a lift if it becomes unstable could result in sprains, serious back injuries, or bone fractures.

The Artis zee system may lose coolant due to a possible leakage in a hose of the cooling unit in the X-ray tube. This will cause the X-ray tube not to be sufficiently cooled down. As a result, the system will display a message  Tube hot, have a break . The X-ray will be blocked several minutes later and to prevent any damage to the machine the following message will be displayed  NO XRAY, TUBE TOO HOT .
