The combined system maintains independent functionality of the MR and PET devices, allowing for single modality MR and/or PET imaging. These systems are intended to be utilized by appropriately trained health care professionals to aid in the detection, localization, and diagnosis of diseases and disorders. The MR is intended to produce transverse, sagittal, coronal and oblique cross-sectional MR images, spectroscopic images and/or spectra, and displays the internal structure and/or function of the human body. Other physical parameters derived from the images and/or spectra may also be produced. Depending on the region of interest, approved contrast agents may be used, as described in their labeling. This system may also be used for imaging during interventional procedures when performed with MR compatible devices, such as MR safe biopsy needles. The PET images and measures the distribution of PET radiopharmaceuticals in humans to aid the physician in determining various metabolic (molecular) and physiologic functions within the human body for evaluation of diseases and disorders such as, but not limited to, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and cancer. The combined system utilizes the MR for radiationfree attenuation correction maps for PET studies.
