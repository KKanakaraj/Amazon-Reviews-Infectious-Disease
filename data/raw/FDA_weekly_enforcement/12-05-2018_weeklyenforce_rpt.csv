An antigen-antibody reaction begins by combining a patient sample, control, or calibrator with a diluent in an immunoreaction test cup from the AIA-PACK reagent series.  ","247","Tosoh Bioscience has become aware of a potential issue with the axis base of the turntable rotation drive  motor on the AIA-900 Analyzer. If the tension of the timing belt between the turntable rotation pulley and  drive motor is not adjusted correctly, it is possible to increase the lateral load on the motor axis resulting  in the inclination and damage of the motor axis. Since January 12, 2017, Tosoh has been inspecting the  tension of the timing belt during scheduled preventative maintenance visit and correcting the analyzers  where this issue has been observed. If the drive motor fails, the AIA-900 analyzer will cease to function and will be unavailable for use. If this  issue occurs, there may be a delay in testing and reporting patient test results. Tosoh has received five (5)  complaints related to this issue with no serious injuries reported.","10/05/2018","11/28/2018","","12/05/2018","Serial nos. 10142204 10373208 10493811 10614102  10212711 10403809 10503612 10634103  10253102R 10463110 10513412 10654404"

The trocar cannula consists of two seals, an outer integrated removable self-adjusting seal that may accommodate instruments ranging from 5mm to 12mm in diameter, and an internal seal. These seals minimize gas leakage when instruments are inserted or withdrawn through the seal. The stopcock valve provides attachment for gas insufflation and desufflation.
