The iChemVELOCITY can be used as a stand-alone system, as well as in an iQ200 Series system, a configuration given the proprietary name iRICELL as it is designed to be hardware and software compatible with iQ200 Series systems. It produces quantitative results for specific gravity, semi- quantitative results for glucose, blood, leukocyte esterade, bilirubin, urobilinogen, pH, protein, ketones, and ascorbic acid; and qualitative results for nitrites, color, and clarity. iChemVELOCITY strips are intended for use only with the iChemVELOCITY analyzer. In particular they are not intended for visual reading. The iChemVELOCITY is not intended to be used as a Point of Care (POC) analyzer. The measurements are used to aid in the diagnosis of metabolic disorders, kidney function anomalies, urinary tract infections, and liver finction. Tests performed using the iChemVELOCITY are intended for clinical laboratory use and in vitro diagnostic use only.  ","2225 units","Beckman Coulter has determined that there is a potential for incorrect settings to be installed on North American iChemVELOCITY Urine Chemistry Analyzers.    1. The installation of International settings can result in the generation of erroneous, false low results for some of the analytes at some concentrations.  2. The installation of colors different from those stated in the Instructions for Use (Colorless, Straw, Yellow, Amber, Red, Blue) for output settings will result in incorrect reporting of colors. For example, if Green is the color choice for the output setting instead of Blue, Green will be reported.","03/02/2018","05/04/2018","","05/16/2018","All Fielded Serial Numbers with North American Configuration settings"
