Product Usage;    Device Classification: The INOmeter is an accessory to the nitric oxide delivery device which is used for the delivery of inhaled nitric oxide to patient. An INOmeter is affixed to each cylinder of drug product. Functionality of the INOmeter: The INOmeter is affixed on top of each INOflo cylinder valve in Japan. When the healthcare provider opens the INOmeter the compressed gas cylinder valve opens to begin flow of the nitric oxide in nitrogen compressed gas. The nitric oxide gas is administered to a patient via a nitric oxide delivery device. The amount of time that gas flow administered to a patient is captured in the INOmeter. Each INOmeter is programmed to include the drug product expiration date as listed on the INOflo drug product label. The INOmeter electronically communicates to the nitric oxide delivery device via infrared technology by way of the iButton and in so communicates the expiration date of the corresponding cylinder of INOflo drug product to the delivery device. The delivery device evaluates and compares the expiration date to the current date of therapy administration. If the drug product expiration date is prior to the current date, an error and alarm is registered by the nitric oxide delivery device and administration of the expired drug to the patient is stopped after 120 seconds. If this occurs, the healthcare provider can operate the nitric oxide delivery device manually and deliver the INOflo as indicated in the Instructions For Use (IFU). The INOflo delivery device has the functionality to administer INOflo in manual mode.  ","108 units","INOmeters affixed to the INOflo cylinders in Lot 17FP-0570 were programmed with an incorrect expiration date (11/2017).
