The CT component produces cross-sectional images of the body by computer reconstruction of X-Ray transmission data from either the same axial plane taken at different angles or spiral planes taken at different angles. The PET subsystem images and measures the distribution of PET radiopharmaceuticals in humans for the purpose of determining various metabolic (molecular) and physiologic functions within the human body and utilizes the CT for fast attenuation correction maps for PET studies and precise anatomical reference for the fused PET and CT images. The system maintains independent functionality of the CT and PET devices, allowing for single modality CT and / or PET diagnostic imaging. These systems are intended to be utilized by appropriately trained health care professionals to aid in detecting, localizing, diagnosing, staging and restaging of lesions, tumors, disease and organ function for the evaluation of diseases and disorders such as, but not limited to, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and cancer. The images produced by the system can also be used by the physician to aid in radiotherapy treatment planning and interventional radiology procedures.
