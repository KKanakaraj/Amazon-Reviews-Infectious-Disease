JUDE MEDICAL - Product Usage: St. Jude Medical Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)leads are intended to deliver stimulation to target areas in the brain. DBS extensions are intended to connect the leads to implantable pulse generators (IPGs). St. Jude Medical DBS leads are designed for introduction into the brain using standard stereotactic neurosurgical techniques. DBS system delivers electrical stimulation to a precisely targeted area in the brain. Leads are implanted in the brain and are connected to extensions, which are passed under the skin and are connected to the neurostimulator. Leads for the St. Jude Medical Infinity DBS System feature electrodes on a stiff distal end with an inactive lead tip. The proximal end of the lead contains contact bands that correspond with each of the distal electrodes and an inactive band that functions as a contact for a setscrew when connecting to a compatible extension. The 8-channel leads contain cylindrical and segmented electrodes. The segmented electrodes can be activated independently to focus stimulation in one direction to help target desired neurological structures. As stated in Clinician manual (ARTEN600008305 Rev A), leads materials which are intended to come into contact with tissue are Platinum-iridium and polycarbonate urethane. In addition, drawing for the Stim Tip, 1-3-3-1 Directional DBS lead requires that the electrode material shall be 90/10 Platinum Iridium.","","The most proximal unsegmented electrode of the Deep Brain Stimulation leads, may be constructed with MP35N instead of the required 90/10 platinum-iridium.","10/11/2018","12/10/2018","","12/19/2018","For Model 6170ANS:  UDI/GTIN - 05415067020635 /

The HVAD Pump Controller is a microprocessor unit that controls and manages HeartWare System operation. It sends power and operating signals to the blood pump and collects information from the pump. The controller requires two power sources for safe operation: either two batteries, or one battery and an AC adapter or DC adapter. While active, patients will typically use two batteries. While relaxing or sleeping, patients should use power from an electrical outlet (AC adapter) because it provides power for an unlimited period of time. The HeartWare Battery Charger is part of the HeartWare Ventricular Assist System (HVAD). Patients receive 4 total batteries with their system along with a battery charger and are instructed to have spare, fully charged batteries always available. The battery charger can charge up to 4 batteries at a time using 4 charging bays. Each battery slides into a bay and is connected to the battery charger.","2031","HVAD Battery Charger units manufactured with wrong inductors.","11/19/2018","12/07/2018","","12/19/2018","BCH000403,
