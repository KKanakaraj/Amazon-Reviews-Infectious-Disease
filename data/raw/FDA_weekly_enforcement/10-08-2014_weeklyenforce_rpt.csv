For the Symbia T16/T6/T2, the ultra fast multi-slice spiral CT maximizes confidence in diagnostic stand-alone CT, as well as precise attenuation correction and anatomical mapping. Acquisitions can be performed with either the CT preceding the nuclear acquisition or vice versa.  Indications for use: SPECT: To detect or image the distribution of radionuclides in the body or organ, using the following techniques: planar imaging, whole body imaging, tomographic imaging for isotopes with energies up to 588keV. CT: The CT component is intended to produce cross sectional images of the body by computer reconstruction of x-ray transmission data from either the same axial place taken at different angles or spiral planes taken at different angles. SPECT+CT: Perform CT scans and nuclear imaging studies within the same instrument. To obtain attenuation corrected images and to provide registration of anatomical and physiological images within the patient's anatomy.","1039 systems","Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. is performing a field correction because we recently detected a rubber isolator with unfavorable aging properties. The function of the rubber isolator, which is situated within the rotate motor mounting assembly, may degrade over time and may impact motor support. The event does not pose a hazard by itself but could lead to a rupture of the drive belt which in t","07/28/2014","09/29/2014","12/23/2016","10/08/2014","1) Symbia T; Product Code: 10275007; Serial Numbers: 1055 ,  1056 ,  1057 ,  1058 ,  1060 ,  1061 ,  1062 ,  1063 ,  1064 ,  1065 ,  1066 ,  1067 ,  1068 ,  1069 ,  1070 ,  1071 ,  1072 ,  1073 ,  1074 ,  1075 ,  1076 ,  1077 ,  1078 ,  1079 ,  1080 ,  1081 ,  1082 ,  1083 ,  1084 ,  1085 ,  1086 ,  1087 ,  1088 ,  1089 ,  1090 ,  1091 ,  1092 ,  1094 ,  1095 ,  1096 ,  1097 ,  1098 ,  1099 ,  1100 ,  1101 ,  1102 ,  1103 ,  1104 ,  1105 ,  1106 ,  1107 ,  1108 ,  1109 ,  1110 ,  1111 ,  1112 ,  1113 ,  1114 ,  1115 ,  1116 ,  1117 ,  1118 ,  1119 ,  1120 ,  1121 ,  1122 ,  1123 ,  1124 ,  1125 ,  1126 ,  1127 ,  1128 ,  1129 ,  1130 ,  1131 ,  1132 ,  1133 ,  1134 ,  1135 ,  1136 ,  1137 ,  1138 ,  1139 ,  1140 ,  1141 ,  1142 ,  1143 ,  1144 ,  1145 ,  1146 ,  1147 ,  1148 ,  1149 ,  1150 ,  1151 ,  1152 ,  1153 ,  1154 ,  1155 ,  1156 ,  1157 ,  1158 ,  1159 ,  1160 ,  1161 ,  1162 ,  1163 ,  1164 ,  1165 ,  1166 ,  1167 ,  1168 ,  1169 ,  1170 ,  1171 ,  1172 ,  1173 ,  1175 ,  1176 ,  1177 ,  1178 ,  1179 ,  1180 ,  1181 ,  1182 ,  1183 ,  1184 ,  1185 ,  1186 ,  1187 ,  1188 ,  1189 ,  1190 ,  1191 ,  1192 ,  1193 ,  1194 ,  1195 ,  1196 ,  1197 ,  1198 ,  1199 ,  1200 ,  1201 ,  1202 ,  1203 ,  1204 ,  1205 ,  1206 ,  1207 ,  1208 ,  1209 ,  1210 ,  1211 ,  1212 ,  1213 ,  1214 ,  1215 ,  1216 ,  1217 ,  1218 ,  1219 ,  1220 ,  1221 ,  1222 ,  1223 ,  1224 ,  1225 ,  1226 ,  1227 ,  1228 ,  1229 ,  1230 ,  1231 ,  1232 ,  1233 ,  1234 ,  1235 ,  1236 ,  1238 ,  1239 ,  1240 ,  1241 ,  1242 ,  1243 ,  1244 ,  1245 ,  1246 ,  1247 ,  1248 ,  1249 ,  1250 ,  1251 ,  1252 ,  1253 ,  1254 ,  1255 ,  1256 ,  1257 ,  1258 ,  1259 ,  1260 ,  1261 ,  1262 ,  1263 ,  1264 ,  1265 ,  1266 ,  1267 ,  1268 ,  1269 ,  1270 ,  1271 ,  1272 ,  1273 ,  1275 ,  1276 ,  1277 ,  1278 ,  1279 ,  1280 ,  1281 ,  1282 ,  1283 ,  1284 ,  1285 ,  1286 ,  1287 ,  1288 ,  1289 ,  1290 ,  1291 ,  1292 ,  1293 ,  1294 ,  1295 ,  1296 ,  1297 ,  1298 ,  1299 ,  1300 ,  1301 ,  1302 ,  1303 ,  1304 ,  1305 ,  1306 ,  1307 ,  1308 ,  1309 ,  1310 ,  1311 ,  1312 ,  1313 ,  1314 ,  1315 ,  1317 ,  1318 ,  1319 ,  1320 ,  1321 ,  1322 ,  1323 ,  1324 ,  1325 ,  1326 ,  1327 ,  1328 ,  1329 ,  1330 ,  1331 ,  1332 ,  1333 ,  1334 ,  1335 ,  1336 ,  1337 ,  1338 ,  1339 ,  1340 ,  1341 ,  1342 ,  1343 ,  1344 ,  1345 ,  1346 ,  1347 ,  1348 ,  1349 ,  1350 ,  1351 ,  1352 ,  1353 ,  1354 ,  1355 ,  1356 ,  1357 ,  1358 ,  1359 ,  1360 ,  1361 ,  1362 ,  1363 ,  1364 ,  1365 ,  1366 ,  1367 ,  1368 ,  1369 ,  1370 ,  1371 ,  1372 ,  1373 ,  1374 ,  1375 ,  1376 ,  1377 ,  1378 ,  1379 ,  1380 ,  1381 ,  1382 ,  1383 ,  1384 ,  1385 ,  1386 ,  1387 ,  1388 ,  1389 ,  1390 ,  1391 ,  1392 ,  1393 ,  1394 ,  1395 ,  1396 ,  1397 ,  1398 ,  1399 ,  1400 ,  1401 ,  1402 ,  1403 ,  1404 ,  1405 ,  1406 ,  1407 ,  1408 ,  1409 ,  1410 ,  1411 ,  1412 ,  1413 ,  1414 ,  1415 ,  1416 ,  1417 ,  68282 ;

This manual also describes the Symbia Intevo Excel. The Symbia Intevo series integrates state-of-the-art SPECT and high quality spiral CT to provide precise attenuation correction and anatomical mapping. The system can also be used as a complete clinical SPECT system for general purpose, whole body (WB) and SPECT applications.   The Symbia Intevo Excel integrates state-of-the-art SPECT and high quality spiral CT to give the system SPECT functionality, with attenuation correction.   The Symbia Intevo 2 integrates state-of-the-art SPECT and high quality dual slice spiral CT to give the system full functionality for all SPECT-only, xSPECT, or stand-alone CT diagnostic applications in Oncology, Neurology, and Cardiology.   The Symbia Intevo 6 integrates state-of-the-art SPECT and high quality six slice spiral CT to give the system full functionality for all SPECT-only, xSPECT, or stand-alone CT diagnostic applications in Oncology, Neurology, and Cardiology.   The Symbia Intevo 16 integrates state-of-the-art SPECT and high quality sixteen slice spiral CT to give the system full functionality for all SPECT-only, xSPECT, or stand-alone CT diagnostic applications in Oncology, Neurology, and Cardiology.  Indications for use: SPECT: To detect or image the distribution of radionuclides in the body or organ, using the following techniques: planar imaging, whole body imaging, tomographic imaging for isotopes with energies up to 588keV. CT: The CT component is intended to produce cross sectional images of the body by computer reconstruction of x-ray transmission data from either the same axial place taken at different angles or spiral planes taken at different angles. SPECT+CT: Perform CT scans and nuclear imaging studies within the same instrument. To obtain attenuation corrected images and to provide registration of anatomical and physiological images within the patient's anatomy.","48 systems","Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. is performing a field correction because we recently detected a rubber isolator with unfavorable aging properties.
