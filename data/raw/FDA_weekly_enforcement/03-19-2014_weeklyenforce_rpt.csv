K102239 CARESCAPE Monitor B650 The CARESCAPE Monitor B650 is a multi-parameter patient monitor intended for use in multiple areas and intra-hospital transport within a professional healthcare facility. The CARESCAPE Monitor B650 is intended for use on adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients and on one patient at a time. The CARESCAPE Monitor B650 is indicated for monitoring and recording of, and to generate alarms for, hemodynamic (including ECG, ST segment, arrhythmia detection, ECG diagnostic analysis and measurement, invasive pressure, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, cardiac output, temperature and mixed venous oxygen saturation), impedance respiration, airway gases (CO2, O2, N2O and anesthetic agents), spirometry, gas exchange, and neurophysiological (including electroencephalography, Entropy, Bispectral Index (BIS) and neuromuscular transmission(NMT) status. The CARESCAPE Monitor B650 can be a stand-alone monitor or interfaced to other devices. It can also be connected to other monitors for remote viewing and to data management software devices via a network. The CARESCAPE Monitor B650 is intended for use under the direct supervision of a licensed healthcare practitioner, or by personnel trained in proper use of the equipment in a professional healthcare facility. The CARESCAPE Monitor B650 is not intended for use during MRI.

The CARESCAPE Monitor B850 system is indicated for monitoring of Hemodynamic (including ECG, ST Segment, Arrhythmia Detection, ECG Diagnostic Analysis and Measurement, Invasive Pressure, Noninvasive Blood Pressure, Pulse Oximetry, Cardiac Output, Temperature, Impedance Respiration and SvO2 (Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation), Airway Gases (Fi/Et C02, 02, N20 and Anesthetic Agent), Spirometry, Gas Exchange (02 Consumption (VO2), C02 production (VCO2), energy expenditure (BE), and respiratory quotient (RQ)) and neurophysiological (including electroencephalography (EEG), Entropy, Bispectral Index (BIS) and Neuromuscular Transmission (NMT) Monitoring) status. The CARESCAPE Monitor B850 provides alarms, trends, snapshots and events, and calculations and can be connected to displays, printers and recording devices. The CARESCAPE Monitor B850 can be a stand-alone monitor or interfaced to other devices. It can also be connected to other monitors for bed to bed viewing and to data management software devices via a network. The CARESCAPE Monitor B850 is intended for use under the direct supervision of a licensed healthcare practitioner, or by personnel trained in proper use of the equipment in a professional healthcare facility. In addition to the healthcare practitioner, the CARESCAPE Monitor B850 is designed to provide configuration and troubleshooting capabilities to qualified service personnel.
