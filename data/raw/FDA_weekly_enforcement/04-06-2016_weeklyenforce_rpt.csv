Product Usage:  The SOLITAIRETM SPINAL SYSTEM is designed for use with autograft and is indicated for stand-alone intervertebral body fusion at one level or two contiguous levels in the lumbar spine from L2 to S1 in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at the involved level(s). DDD is defined as back pain of discogenic origin with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history and radiographic studies. These patients should be skeletally mature and have had six months of non-operative treatment. Additionally, the SOLITAIRETM ANTERIOR SPINAL SYSTEM is indicated for use in the thoracolumbar spine (i.e., T10 to L5) to replace a diseased vertebral body resected or excised for the treatment of tumors in order to achieve anterior decompression of the spinal cord and neural tissues, and to restore the height of a collapsed vertebral body. The SolitaireTM System is also indicated for treating fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. The SolitaireTM System is designed to restore the biomechanical integrity of the anterior, middle and posterior spinal column even in the absence of fusion for a prolonged period.

In addition, calculated values of base excess, bicarbonate, oxygen saturation, and oxygen consumption may also be provided. These parameters are displayed at either actual temperature or adjusted to 37 C. For documentation purposes, the system 500s integral printer provides a hard copy of displayed parameters.  ","222","Specific CDI¿ Blood Parameter Monitoring System 500 devices are being voluntarily recalled because the BPM Sensor Head Assemblys Thermistor, which provides the blood temperature value that results in accurate display values on the monitor, does not meet specification. This may cause inaccurate temperature measurement and inaccurate analyte display values on the CDI System 500 monitor.  Terumo Cardiovascular Systems (Terumo CVS) received complaints of inaccurate temperature measurements for specific devices distributed since November 5, 2015. These include both new production devices and recently serviced devices.  POTENTIAL HAZARD  There have been no reported illnesses or injuries as a result of this issue.  A user who is not aware that the CDI System 500 is displaying inaccurate temperature values may not manage patient temperature appropriately. Using inaccurate information to manage warming and cooling strategies for a procedure could result in prolonged time on bypass. It could also lead to unnecessarily aggressive temperature management, resulting in excessive hyper or hypothermia, with potential neurologic and organ dysfunction, or increased blood component damage.  Inaccurate temperature measurement could also cause inaccurate measurements of other BPM values including potassium (K+), pO2, pCO2, and pH. The greater the temperature inaccuracy, the greater the degree of inaccuracy of these other BPM values due to the dependence of their algorithms on temperature for the calculations. Inaccurate measurement of these values could result in inappropriate patient management strategies being employed to address them with the potential to result in moderate patient injury.","03/14/2016","03/25/2016","03/28/2017","04/06/2016","CDI 500 MONITOR WITH ART/HS   (500AHCT item number 137613)  SN #'s:  1190  1310  1346  1594  1647  1687  1693  1706  1769  1866  2028  2220  2242  2294  2311  2394  2460  2485  2506  2519  2644  2729  2776  2780  2821  2827  2858  2898  2900  3002  3092  3163  3184  3325  3513  3805  3808  3818  3823  3842  4061  4102  4109  5173  5264  5806  8003  8006  8007  8008  8009  8010  8011  8012  8013  8016  8018  8020  8026  8031  8034  8035  8040  8056  8060  500AHCT MTR - CON LOANER        (500AHCTCL item number 411150)  SN #'s:  1035  1060  1178  1198  1199  1228  1280  1325  1364  1535  1540  1545  1553  1557  1615  1689  1695  1743  1759  1850  1862  1942  1949  1988  2014  2147  2336  2359  2360  2557  2563  2609  3097  3337  3431  3433  3527  4059  4324  4327  5609  5698  5700  5701  5809  5820  5889  5894  5945  5991  7028  7029  7030  7034  7038  7061  500AHCT MONITOR - LOANER        (500AHCTL item number 418538)  SN #'s:  1283  2209  5546  CDI 500 MONITOR WITH ART/VEN    (500AV item number 137621)  SN #'s:  3132  6004  CDI 500 MONITOR W/ ART/VEN/HS   (500AVHCT item number 137630)  SN #'s:  1304  1405  1905  2105  2224  2495  2580  2633  2867  3332  3404  4224  5076  5096  8000  8002  8023  500AVHCT MTR - CON LOANER       (500AVHCTCL item number 411168)  SN #'s:  1036  1043  1046  1149  1151  1152  1264  1353  1354  1381  1389  1393  1624  1954  2074  2126  6016  6041  6042  6046  500AVHCT MONITOR-LOANER         (500AVHCTL item number 372200)  SN #'s:  1015  1038  1466  2035  7081  500AVHCT MONITOR - TRIAL        (500AVHCTTK item number 476543)  SN #'s:  1953  3425  500AV MONITOR - LOANER          (500AVL item number 418520)  SN #:  2023    Outside US.
