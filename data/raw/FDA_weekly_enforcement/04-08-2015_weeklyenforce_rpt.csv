The temporary pacemaker can be used where short-term demand (synchronous) or asynchronous pacing is indicated for therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic purposes. The temporary pacemaker must be used in an environment where the patient is monitored continuously to ensure that it is operating properly and delivering appropriate therapy to the patient. Specific indications for temporary cardiac pacing include, but are not limited to, the following: - Complete heart block - Sinus bradycardia - Sick sinus syndrome - Bradycardia with congestive heart failure - Atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias - Cardiac arrest - Support, management, and evaluation of a patient before permanent pacemaker implantation - Support during permanent pacemaker replacement - Cardiac complications during invasive or surgical procedures - Support following cardiac surgery - Acute myocardial infarction complicated by heart block - Atrial tachyarrhythmias that require high-rate burst pacing for treatment  ","6040 devices","Possible performance issue when used with specific AA-sized (LR6) batteries.
