Cracking, chipping, missing pieces, and delamination of the adhesive have also been reported. In one case, a fragment of the adhesive was detected inside a patient's urethra during a procedure and was retrieved without injury to the patient.    The manufacturer, Olympus Winter & lbe GmbH (""OWi"") has determined that adhesive can be dislodged during the intended use of the cystoscopy bridge or working insert, e.g., when inserting an instrument through the working channel. As a result, a fragment of the adhesive may fall inside the patient's bladder, urethra or uterus and would need to be retrieved, extending the length of the procedure or requiring additional surgical treatment.    The adhesive is used to seal gaps inside the working channel of the cystoscopy bridges and working inserts. In 2013, the adhesive used until then was discontinued and had to be replaced. Current investigations revealed that the durability of the new adhesive is insufficient  ","08/18/2017","02/23/2018","","03/07/2018","Model Numbers and Associated  Lot Numbers: A20975A -- 13-ZW to 172W  A20976A -- 146W to 172W A20977A -- 146W to 174W"

Product Usage:  The Allura Xper series is intended for use on human patients to perform:   Vascular, cardiovascular and neurovascular imaging applications, including diagnostic, interventional and minimally invasive procedures. This includes, e.g., peripheral, cerebral, thoracic and abdominal angiography, as well as PTAs, stent placements, embolisations and thrombolysis.   Cardiac imaging applications including diagnostics, interventional and minimally invasive procedures (such as PTCA, stent placing, atherectomies), pacemaker implanatations, and electrophysiology (EP).   Non-vascular interventions such as drainages, biopsies and vertebroplasties procedures.  ","705","There is an increase in the failure rate of certain Anode Drive Units (ADU5) used in these products.  Early life failure of the ADUs only occurs when the hospital mains provide 480V to the system. This current voltage may lead to saturation and overheating of the coils that protect the IGBTs (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) of the ADU.  The overheating may also generate a peculiar burning smell that may be noticed. In some instances this burning smell may be noticed before the ADU fails.  When the ADU fails the X-ray performance of the system is reduced to  Emergency Fluoroscopy. Exposure will not be possible and image quality is reduced.","01/04/2018","02/24/2018","10/09/2019","03/07/2018","Allura Xper systems  - Model #'s 722026, 722027, 722028, 722029, 722033, 722034, 722035, 722036, 722038, 722039, 722058, 722059, 722063, 722064, 722065, 722066, 722078, 722079, (added as of 6/25/2018) 1120"

They provide localized lighting focused on the patient s body for detecting and treating disease, injury, and disability. The surgical lights may only be used in rooms used for medical purposes that have been equipped in accordance with VDE 0100-710 or IEC 60364-7-10 in accordance with the regulations. The Chromophare surgical lights consist of a ceiling tube, SK Box swivel arm support, and a light head. The light head is mounted on a cardanic suspension unit and can be turned, swiveled and tilted in any direction. The spatial repositioning of the light head makes use of the 360 degree rotating swivel/horizontal arm. The 360 degree rotating spring arm is used to adjust the height. The light can be mounted in several configurations, such as a single/dual ceiling mount, a boom-integrated suspension mount, a wall mount, or a mobile roll stand.
