The solution is used prior to a lipase (LIP) assay if an interferant assay (TRIG)is part of the work list. The major interferant for Lipase is the Triglycerides (TRIG) assay since one of the reagents contains lipase as an active ingredient.","392","The firm  has initiated a field recall of the Wash1 Kit REF 10680 due to reported inconsistent Lipase values when analyzing patient samples. The firm's internal investigation identified the underlying cause to be an ineffective wash solution resulting in an interference carryover from the triglyceride (TRIG) assay if they are on the same worklist.
