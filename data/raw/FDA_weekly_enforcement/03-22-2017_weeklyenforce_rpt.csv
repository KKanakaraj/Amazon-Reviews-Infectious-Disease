Model number: FG-1012    Product Usage:  The C2 CryoBalloon Ablation System is intended for use as a cryosurgical tool in the field of general surgery, specifically for endoscopic applications, to include ablation of Barrett s Esophagus with dysplasia. It is a cryosurgical system with a nitrous oxide cooled balloon that is compatible with a commercially available endoscope with a minimum working channel inner diameter (ID) of 3.7 mm and length of 100 cm. The C2 CryoBalloon System is a system comprised of a Catheter (sterile), Controller (non-sterile), and Cartridge (non-sterile). The Device is used to ablate unwanted tissue by application of extreme cold. The balloon at the distal end of the Catheter comes in contact with tissue and is inflated with nitrous oxide. Tissue is visualized through the inflated balloon, and the treatment site is selected by adjusting the endoscope and Controller position. The nitrous oxide spray cools the balloon to ablate the unwanted tissue, and the nitrous oxide exhausts through the Controller.
