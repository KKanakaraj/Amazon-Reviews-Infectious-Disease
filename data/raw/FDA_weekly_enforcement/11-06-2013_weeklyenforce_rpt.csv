The CT subsystem produces cross sectional images of the body by computer reconstruction of x-ray transmission data. The PET subsystem produces images of the distribution of PET radiopharmaceuticals in the patient body (specific radiopharmaceuticals are used for whole body, brain, heart and other Oran imaging). Attenuation correction is accomplished by CTAC. The device also provides for list mode, dynamic, and gated acquisitions. Image processing and display workstations provide software applications to process, analyze, display, quantify and interpret medical images/data. The PET and CT images may be registered and displayed in a ""fused"" (overlaid in the same spatial orientation) format to provide combined metabolic and anatomical data at different angles. Trained professionals use the images in: The evaluation, detection and diagnosis of lesions, disease and organ function such as but not limited to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders The detection, localization, and staging of tumors and diagnosing cancer patients. Treatment planning and interventional radiology procedures. The device includes software that provides a quantified analysis of regional cerebral activity from PET images. Cardiac imaging software provides functionality for quantification of cardiology images and data sets including but not limited to myocardial perfusion for the display of wall motion and quantification ventricular or left-function parameters from gated myocardial perfusion studies and for the 3D alignment of coronary artery images from CT coronary angiography onto the myocardium.
