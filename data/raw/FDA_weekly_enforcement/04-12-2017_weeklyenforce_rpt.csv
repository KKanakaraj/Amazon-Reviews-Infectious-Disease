The cameras can be used to perform planar static, dynamic, gated, and total body studies, as well as circular-orbit and noncircular orbit SPECT studies, gated SPECT (circular and noncircular)studies, computer-programmed protocol strings, and reference scans (dual detectors only). BrightView XCT is a gamma camera for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and integrates with an attenuation device consisting of flat panel x-ray imaging components. BrightView XCT produces non-attenuation corrected SPECT images and attenuation corrected SPECT images with an x-ray transmission data that may also be used for scatter correction. The nuclear medicine images and BrightView XCT images may be registered and displayed in a fused format (overlaid in the same orientation) to provide anatomical localization of the nuclear medicine data. The BrightView XCT imaging system should only be used by trained healthcare professionals.","27 systems","The brake hub was not engaging with the gear box shaft due to an error in the assembly of components within the brake hub mechanism after service, causing the detector to backdrive.","02/24/2017","04/06/2017","07/02/2018","04/12/2017","11000105, 11000116, 11000018, 11000047, 11000046, 11000010, 11000068, 11000098, 11000083, 11000013, 11000107, 11000056, 11000042, 11000093, 11000089, 11000104, 11000077, 11000028, 11000085, 11000040, 11000076, 11000117, 11000058, 11000118, 11000086, 11340005, 11000064"
