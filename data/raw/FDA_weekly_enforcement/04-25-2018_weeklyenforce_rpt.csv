The device utilizes the CT technology to obtain anatomic images of the human body and PET technology to obtain functional images of the human body. The clinical value of both technologies increases with the capability to fuse the CT and PET images using Philips fusion viewer Image Fusion software to create a composite image for diagnostic study and therapeutic planning. The system also provides tools for the quantification of results of the CT and PET images and provides the means for a simplified review of the CT, PET, and fused images. The integration of the anatomical data from CT with the metabolic data from PET gives clinicians the visual information necessary to define the severity, as well as the extent, of the disease.
