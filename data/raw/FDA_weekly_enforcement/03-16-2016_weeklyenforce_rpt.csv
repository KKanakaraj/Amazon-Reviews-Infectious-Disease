PET Discovery ST system - The GE Discovery ST system is intended for head and whole body attenuation corrected Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and localization of emission activity in patient anatomy by means of integrated PET and CT images. The Discovery ST is to be used by trained health care professionals for imaging the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals in the body for the assessment of metabolic (molecular) and physiologic functions. This can assist in the evaluation, diagnosis, staging, restaging, and follow up of lesions, disease and organ function such as (but not limited to) cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain dysfunction. This device can also assist in radiotherapy planning. The Discovery ST system can also be used as a stand-alone head and whole body multi-slice computed tomography (CT) diagnostic imaging system.

This can assist in the evaluation, diagnosis, staging, restaging, and follow up of lesions, disease and organ function such as (but not limited to) cancer, cardiovascular disease, and brain dysfunction. This device can also assist in radiotherapy planning. The Discovery LS can also be used as a stand-alone head and whole body multislice computed tomography (CT) diagnostic imaging system.
