The images can be acquired in either axial, helical, gated or dynamic modes. The volume datasets acquired by the SCENARIA can be post processed by the SCENARIA to provide additional information. Post processing capabilities included in the SCENARIA software include CT angiography (CTA), Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) and volume rendering. Volume datasets acquired by the SCENARIA Phase 3 can be transferred to external devices via a DICOM standard interface. The guideShot Option adds a remote in-room display and controls to support interventional imaging. The device output can provide an aid to diagnosis when used by a qualified physician.  ","1","The firm received a complaint where, during patient positioning, the technologist was adjusting the patient table height and the table failed to stop when the control was released and contacted the CT gantry. The problem could not be duplicated at the site, so to avoid further issues while a root cause investigation was pursued, Hitachi choose to add an optional touch sensor to the gantry to add a redundant level of protection. It is conceivable that a patient s extremity may be caught between the tabletop and the gantry surface during uncontrolled motion or that the table contact of the gantry might cause internal damage to the unit.","06/29/2018","08/17/2018","","08/29/2018","S7004"
