The Signa Infinity System is indicated for use as a diagnostic imaging device to produce transverse, sagittal, coronal and oblique images, spectroscopic images, and/or spectra, dynamic images of the internal structures and organs of the entire body, including but not limited to, head, neck, TMJ, spine, breast, heart, abdomen, pelvis, joints, prostate, blood vessels, and musculoskeletal regions of the body. The images produced by the Signa Infinity systems reflect the spatial distribution of protons (hydrogen nuclei) exhibiting magnetic resonance. These images and/or spectra when interpreted by a trained physician yield information that may assist in diagnosis.","7016 (2919 US; 4097 OUS)","Screen save images are included in wrong exam due to duplicate UID creation.
