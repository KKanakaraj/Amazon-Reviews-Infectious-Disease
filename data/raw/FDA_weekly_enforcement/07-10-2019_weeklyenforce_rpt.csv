The CPR monitoring function provides a metronome designed to encourage rescuers to perform chest compressions at the AHA/ERC recommended rate of 100 compressions per minute. Voice and visual prompts encourage a compression depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) for adult patients. The AED PRO system is indicated for use on victims of cardiac arrest with apparent lack of circulation as indicated by:   Unconsciousness   Absence of breathing, and   Absence of pulse and other signs of circulation. The device is also indicated for use when ECG monitoring is indicated to evaluate the patient s heart rate or ECG morphology. The AED PRO system is indicated for adult and pediatric patients.
