The Micro SSPTM DNA Typing Tray provides sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers for amplification of HLA alleles and the human -globin gene by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-optimized primers are presented (dried) in different wells of well thin-walled tube tray for PCR. The tray is ready for the addition of DNA samples, recombinant taq polymerase, and specially formulated dNTP-buffer mix (Micro SSPTM D-Mix). Each typing tray includes a negative control reaction tube that detects the presence of the internal control PCR product generated by the Micro SSPTM DNA Typing Tray. The internal (positive) control PCR product amplified from the Human -globin gene is amplified in every test well, along with the primer-specified HLA allele, if present in the test sample. Positive typing bands indicate amplification of specific HLA alleles. For each lot, the specific HLA alleles can be identified using the provided user documents(codesheet, resolution limitations, primer information, worksheet) and using the procedure described in the provided product insert.","45 (33 within U.S. and 12 internationally); 1 lot","HLA Class I DNA Typing Trays, missing allele specific lot documentation, were distributed.","11/26/2014","12/18/2014","03/10/2015","12/24/2014","Model No.: SSP1L  Product Code: N/A  Lot/Serial No.: Lot 010; Batches 001-006"
