Rx only, Sterilized using Ethylene Oxide.      DOLPHIN is a single-use, sterile inflation device used in cardiovascular procedures to pressurize (inflate) and depressurize (deflate) balloon catheters.  The device itself consists of two components - the inflation device and large volume syringe (30 cc).    The manually operation of the DOLPHIN is achieved by the manipulation of a large handle to drive a piston housed within the body of the device.  Careful and controlled inflation is achieved by rotating the handle clockwise.  During inflation a unique cam locking mechanism maintains pressure even if the user lets go of the device.    Instantaneous deflation, regardless of balloon size, is made possible by the release of the dual locks located on device as well as a large, 30 cc syringe that is sold with each Dolphin Inflation Device.    All the while during inflation or deflation pressure is displayed and can be monitored on a large analog gauge mounted on top of the device.

The InfoV.A.C. and V.A.C.ULTA Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Systems are integrated wound management systems for use in acute, and extended and care settings. They are intended to create an environment that promotes wound healing by secondary or tertiary (delayed primary) intention by preparing the wound bed for closure, reducing edema, promoting granulation tissue formation and perfusion, and by removing exudate and infectious material. Open wound types include chronic, acute, traumatic, subacute, and dehisced wounds, partial thickness burns, ulcers (such as Diabetic, pressure, or venous insufficiency), flaps and grafts. When used on closed surgical incisions they are intended to manage the environment of surgical incisions that continue to drain following sutured or stapled closure by maintaining a closed environment and removing exudates via the application of negative pressure wound therapy.
