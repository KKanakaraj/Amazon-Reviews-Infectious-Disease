A mismatch occurred between the screw holes in the Distal Humeral Body & the Discovery Elbow Condyle implant during vendor machine operation. The condition would be noticed during assembly and therefore, if the product has already been implanted, no further action is required. The mismatch does not always prevent engagement of the screw, based on complaints received it is estimated to prevent engagement of the screw in less than 1% of cases.","02/28/2018","03/23/2018","","04/04/2018","Model numbers:  211250  211251  211252  211253  211254  211255    Lot codes:  095580  119120  130020  142530  155910  162450  162460  241160  257860  304290  305860  309730  337610  389790  400730  419380  430570  443670  545430  546260  548290  550390  586120  606830  611540  636370  636470  688540  704020  714760  793670  806070  829520  829530  881230  950270  970920  019600  110780  130040  157180  185620  203520  241180  278580  330870  364380  424550  430580  457210  544340  583360  636520  706690  714810  810260  853250  881330  883830  891880  923660  923680  991400  033700  053800  062210  110790  160770  185630  241190  247810  257870  347080  583370  611530  636680  638640  674650  688550  775020  829540  848530  889330  950310  976390  988380  991410  028450  028460  053810  062220  098020  155900  160780  231490  241230  251120  251920  257880  281140  330880  347100  367850  400390  450780  493220  494170  527200  546290  548460  548470  548580  586130  611520  636710  665880  704030  761210  829550  853260  889810  914750  923670  923690  925920  927420  937130  991320  062830  119130  130070  185590  196660  201270  241290  247280  247290  257890  338480  347110  350590  366310  554450  636760  648150  704040  714830  750840  767880  793710  829560  878430  927430  948090  952960  970930  976410  040470  192770  241300  258540  288580  293740  320100  340150  347700  364660  419900  442840  462480  462490  569770  611040  611930  688560  770690  780490  815100  818160  829690  867530  891270  923980  924160  927440"
