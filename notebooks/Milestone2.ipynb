Easy to miss.Okay, I wish I had been able to read the ingredient list, but I was ordering from my cell phone. I looked. The description was limited, as were the reviews it showed. 2 kinds of rice flour before almond at all? I honestly expected the tapioca, even a little rice or potato starch (hoped for arrowroot instead) I also EXPECTED Almond Meal to be FIRST. Or at least high on the list. Not maybe a tablespoon, so they can claim it. Like the sugary cereals that claim made with whole grains, so it looks healthier. (A very tiny potion being whole grain of course!) This is the same thing. Quite a disappointment.People GF, looking for RICE FLOUR with a bit of almond added in for protein, this is good for. I see it making nice gravy and soups. And small breads.Me however, if I could eat this much rice, I would go with the good Sushi I miss, thank you. I will not be adding this to my diet, instead sticking to the healthier almond flour, coconut flour, adding the occasional bit of tapioca and arrowroot.And no, removing gluten and strictly limiting rice in my diet was not a \"choice\" for weight loss or anything.

      "---\n",
      "I'm day by day amazed to realized how many people in this country still doesn't know what is MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) and the dangerous effects it poses to anyone's health.MSG INDUCES OBESITY:MSG is actually injected into laboratory rats to induce obesity.  There are many many scientific studies done using these MSG treated rats since rats are not naturally overweight.  It also has been shown to increase appetite in male rats and to induce obesity in female rats and chickens.  Scientists in Spain have recently concluded that MSG when given to mice increase appetite by as much as 40%.CANCER: MSG AND CANCERThere is evidence that suggests that MSG produced by any method causes or exacerbates cancer(1).  At the same time, there is undeniable evidence that MSG manufactured using acid hydrolysis  always contains carcinogenic mono and dichloro propanols(2-5) and that MSG produced when a Maillard reaction occurs, always contains carcinogenic heterocyclic amines(6).THE BACKGROUNDTruly natural glutamic acid -- as it exists in its unadulterated form in nature -- is an acidic amino acid.  It is found in abundance in both plant and animal protein where it is bound (tied) to other amino acids in chains.  Manufactured glutamic acid (MSG) is different.  It is produced commercially in manufacturing and/or chemical plants, and/or by fermentation.All processed free glutamic acid (MSG) - no matter how produced -- is neurotoxic (it eliminates brain cells) and is endocrine disrupting (damages the endocrine system) (7-8).  In addition, all processed free glutamic acid (MSG) will cause adverse reactions ranging from feelings of mild discomfort or simple skin rash to such things as irritable bowel, asthma, migraine headache, mood swings, heart irregularities, asthma, seizures, and depression when the amount of MSG ingested exceeds a person's MSG-tolerance level(9).All processed free glutamic acid (MSG), no matter how produced, is accompanied by unwanted by-products of production referred to as impurities.  Impurities are invariably produced by all methods used for breaking down protein (autolysis, enzymolysis, and acid hydrolysis)(2,6,10-15); by all methods used to produce monosodium glutamate; and by all methods use to produce reaction or processed flavors(6,10).  Only the impurities associated with the MSG produced by acid hydrolysis and the Maillard reaction include cancer-causing substances.How do we know what we know?  We know from the paper Regulatory status of maillard reactions flavors that Lawrence Lin presented in August 1992 at a meeting of the American Chemical Society(10).  We know from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Review of Toxicological Literature(4).  And we know from the Codex Alimentarius Commission Position Paper on Chloropropanols(5).REFERENCES[1]. Blaylock R. (ed). Blaylock Wellness Report.

      "I am healthy, thankfully, but I recently heard about this product and was intrigued enough to do some research into its effectiveness. I have been reading articles by Dr Andrew Weil (founder of Integrative Medicine and a Harvard Medical School graduate) for many years now and I find his information to be solid and reliable. Here is what he has to say about this product:\"[...] There is no clinical evidence that either Essiac or Flor*Essence has any anti-cancer activity.A number of animal studies have investigated the effects of Essiac and Flor*Essence on cancer. None has found that either product does any good. In fact, a 2004 study at the National Cancer Institute showed that Flor*Essence can promote the growth of mammary tumors in rats. The study was published in the November 2004 issue of Breast Cancer Research and Treatment.While there's no evidence that Essiac or Flor*Essence can help control cancer, both can have unpleasant side effects. Essiac can cause nausea and vomiting, and Flor*Essence has been reported to cause increased bowel movements, frequent urination, swollen glands, skin blemishes, flu-like symptoms, and slight headaches.\"I'm going to list the link with the full article as a comment, otherwise Amazon will remove it. I'm only posting this to inform people. One possible cancer treatment which I have been reading about for several years now is John Kanzius' machine (check out the two 60 Minute programs that were aired about his invention). Human trials will hopefully start soon.\n"
