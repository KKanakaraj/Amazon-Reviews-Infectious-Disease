      <p><strong>About the project:</strong></p>
      <p>Today world has become a highly connected place in which networks are  associated in our day-to-day lives. As we begin to enter the new era of Big Data, the contemporary Recommender System faces greatly increased data size and complexities. Previous computational models and experience on small data may not hold today, thus, how to build an efficient and robust system and how to extract meaningful knowledge from the massive data becomes an important issue and attracts increasing attention on it. For a user it is getting harder to reach the relevant food product items according to his/her personal taste and preferences. It could be better and convenient, if the websites give them some smart advices and also could think from customerâ€˜s perspective of view and provide products that customers never thought but will love when they saw them. In our project, we aim at improving the Amazon Product Recommendation System for large scale Amazon groceries and gourmet food dataset by analyzing the reviews of users.</p>

<p>Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the Amazon Grocery and Gourmet Food Product reviews database and FDA food recalls, we want to distinguish products that users like and dislike and by building a time based link prediction to provide best recommendations to the customers.</p>

<p>Our first plan was to directly relate products from the Amazon datasets to ones of the FDA dataset. This would have provided true-values for possible health threats found in the Amazon dataset which could have been used for training and evaluating our models. However, this would have required us to perform conversions between the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) and the UPC (Universal Product Code) of products in a large scale. Queries like this are restricted by Amazon and therefore not possible for us in our project. In consequence, we decided to still use the FDA dataset but for another purpose. We want to analyze the language in order to possibly link it to the language used in the Amazon reviews. This shall be done by NLP (natural language processing). However, doing that will not solve our problem of missing labels for the products and reviews. To lable our data, we used a work-around using lexical data of words that can be related to health issues and other features of our data.</p>

<p>In our data story we try show how a general bad review of a product (i.e. because of personal taste or false expectations of the user) should be distinguished from health related ones. Using the FDA dataset will help us relating reviews to actual recalls of food products. The overall goal is to enhance Amazon's user experience by considering possible health threats. This would encourage retailers to maintain quality standards, could improve quality of food products and eventually enhance health and life quality of people.</p>
